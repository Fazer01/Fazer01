# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ and welcome to my personal Github page.
My name is Tom and I have bachelors degree in computer science. For a living, I write software at a company that develops applications for several branches of the Dutch and Belgian law enforcement agencies. Very intresting stuff!


Several repositories you can find here are somewhat, old... Let's say not really maintained often. 
Mostly some hobby projects reside here. I am starting to use GitHub a bit more lateley and felt the need to write this amazing readme file!
